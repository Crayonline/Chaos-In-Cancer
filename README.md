## Abstract
The unpredictability of tumors is a problematic barrier to developing personalized cures, and a leading cause of cancer evolution and volatility is attributed to angiogenesis. Tumor angiogenesis exploits the formation of blood vessels that provide a supportive microenvironment rich in oxygen and nutrients required for cancer survival, malignancy, and metastasis. Chaos theory examines the underlying set of patterns and deterministic laws that are highly sensitive to the initial conditions of seemly random dynamical systems not unlike the anomalous branching of angiogenesis. Can a computational network reconstruction of tumor angiogenesis using coupled morphological, genomic, and physiological parameters when applied to chaos theory, determine the extent of unpredictability in tumor angiogenesis? Using Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BIRADS) labelled mammograms, the magnitude of chaos in breast vasculature was uniquely determined using network science analysis and feature importance to generate modified Lorenz equations, which in turn were analyzed by bifurcation diagrams, fractal dimensions, and Lyapunov Characteristic Exponents. Further, a novel network-based drug discovery pipeline with r2 of 0.512 was tested with aromatase, and in vitro validation with P. polycephalum was also investigated. Angiogenesis breast cancer vasculature exhibited a higher Lyapunov exponent than in nontumorous vasculature. Vasculature networks with a higher number of nodes from inferred vascular sprouting, segments from preferential attachment morphology, and smaller mean mesh size from endothelial and pericyte cell interplay were the most chaotic. Additionally, the newfound positive correlation between cancer and chaos indicates underlying chaotic patterns are yet to be explored in angiogenesis. Lastly, the application of chaos theory in clinical diagnosis, angiogenesis drug discovery, and bridging biochemical and mathematical research was proposed.

## Introduction

The project's central research question is as follows: Can a computational network reconstruction of tumor angiogenesis mechanisms using coupled morphological, genomic, and physiological parameters, when applied to chaos theory determine the predictability of tumor angiogenesis?

## Chaos Framework
![3](https://github.com/Crayonline/Chaos-In-Cancer/assets/65458882/aea43954-0a1c-42f9-96c6-2703336f9126)
Chaos theory is an amalgamation of scientific theory and mathematics which examines the underlying set of patterns and deterministic laws that are highly sensitive to the initial conditions of a dynamical system. Systems of deterministic chaos, which appear to be disorganized, highly unpredictable, and subject to vast variation, can in principle, be predicted, hence the namesake “deterministic.” For example, the strange attractor or Lyapunov exponents, mathematical representations of a dynamical system’s unpredictability of tumor angiogenesis, have previously not been studied. We may describe a system’s inherent complexity and unpredictable behaviour; deterministic chaos may uncover latent angiogenic behaviours and bolster the prediction of vasculature development.

The Lorenz attractor was chosen as the modeled dynamical system due to its origins in fluid dynamics, manipulative constants, and well-studied properties in the field of chaos mathematics. Tumor vascularization is conceptualized on a three-axis phase space data frame, x, y, and z where each point in the space is a unique state of the system and has its own rate of change represented by a vector using the Lorenz attractor

## Cancer Network Imaging Framework

This study’s model was developed based on breast cancers due to the accessibility of publicly labelled datasets and the ability to discern vasculature through mammography. In particular, the King Abdulaziz University Breast Cancer Mammogram Dataset was chosen due to images having been previously binned into folders using the BI-RADS (Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System) scheme, enabling the model’s conclusions to be based on well-defined breast cancer diagnosis categories for mammogram screening). 
In discrete mathematics, networks describe relationships between entities through vertices and edges and can be used to capture, communicate, and predict their interactions. Thus the topological features, network properties, and concepts behind graph theory are remarkably relevant towards tumor angiogenesis, and an overview of the novel network analysis variable types considered in this model was described.

Upon computing network variables, a comprehensive set of analytics is conducted to investigate and visualize feature importance, variable correlation, and network clustering using artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms. 

## Molecular Docking Framework

The ChEMBL database web service package was used to retrieve bioactivity data, and for the protein derived from the network, analysis was queried [Figure B-6]. The target query search for compounds will come into contact and induce active and inhibitory responses. To analyze the bioactivity data for the specific targets for the specified target protein, each molecule was described by the Chembl ID molecule names, canonical smiles (describes the chemical connectivity of a molecular structure), standard values (potency of the molecule).

Specific targets for the target protein were filtered using IC50 standard types for uniformity of data type. IC50 was chosen because it reflects the concentration of the drug required to produce a significant effect. Passing through each molecule’s pIC50 value (log of IC50), the most effective compound was discerned through a machine-learning random forest regression model with 100 estimators. The effects of the final compound were visualized in 3D modelling software through the manual manipulation of environmental presets on a diffusion-limited aggregation model. 

## Results
It was observed that generating a 3D plane to model the Lorenz chaotic equation using constants derived from the network feature importance variables, three Lyapunov exponents can thus be used to categorize breast cancer vasculature into four types of attractors: stable fixed point, stable limit cycle, stable 2D tori, and strange attractor as described by the Kaplan-Yorke conjecture. The set of Lyapunov exponents can be regarded as the spectrum of Lyapunov Characteristic Exponents (LCEs) which compare the chaotic unpredictability and characterize the fractal dimension of the biological network.

Based on the signs of the Lyapunov exponents, the fractal dimension of the BIRADS 1 network is a stable fixed point, and this can be visualized by plotting the modified Lorenz equation. The fixed point can be visually observed in the graph, as all perturbations (represented as spirals) eventually reach 0, which is confirmed by the distances of the network’s trajectories oscillating towards the origin. This study thus provides initial evidence that healthy breast vasculature, in particular a BIRADS 1 mammogram, demonstrates stable fixed point behaviour. Consequently, stable fixed point equations can be leveraged to predict the vasculature of healthy breast vasculature.

As the BIRADS categorization increases in the likelihood of cancer, the value of λ2 nears becoming positive. In fact, one can observe an increase in the magnitude of chaos for the plots of BIRADS 3 and 4 through the more loosely wound and continuous spirals. It can then be determined that BIRADS 5, highly suggestive of malignancy (>95% of cancer), is a strange attractor. The BIRADS 5 LCE exhibits one positive Lyapunov exponent, indicating that the dynamic system is chaotic and the distance between the coordinates will exponentially increase. As with BIRADS 1, this study provides the first preliminary evidence which suggests that tumor angiogenesis is chaotic, and thus concepts relating to chaos theory can be applied to determine what underlying chaotic patterns are yet to be explored in angiogenesis.

## In vitro validation with physarum polycephalum (Fun side quest)
![10](https://github.com/Crayonline/Chaos-In-Cancer/assets/65458882/f186f5ca-0575-49a4-a547-9b3a4dfc4875)
Physarum polycephalum (P. Polycephlaum) is a popular organism that has been the subject of a number of computational experiments, in particular regarding its decentralized transportation of information and efficient pathfinding solving problems such as the Traveling Salesman Problem. It is a unicellular organism belonging to Amoebozoa and is most commonly investigated in its vegetative state as a plasmodium, a large mobile cell forming intricate cytoplasmic vein networks consisting of millions of nuclei and an intracellular cytoskeleton. 
The qualitative observations of the change P. Polycephlaum morphogenesis in reaction to an inducing, neutral, or inhibiting environment aligns with the conclusions drawn from the network and chaos theory analysis of angiogenesis. This is representative of solid tumours, which cannot grow beyond 10^6 cells in the absence of a blood supply. Thus this initial pre-vascular phase of growth is followed by a vascular phase in which tumour-induced angiogenesis is the limiting factor for further growth, effectively enabling malignant cells direct access to circulating in the bloodstream, which is observable when comparing the initial expansion between the adverse-neutral-generative cultures. While the generative cultures exhibit “malignancy” through prolific and dense globules of layered tubules surrounding food hubs, neutral cultures have more distinctive tendril pathways and large mesh areas, while adverse cultures seem to resort directly into the neovascular phase with weak islands

## Conclusion

It was found that angiogenesis breast cancer vasculature exhibited a higher Lyapunov exponent than nontumorous vasculature, confirming the hypothesis that angiogenesis architecture can be modelled by deterministic chaos; indeed, cancer is chaos. Vasculatures with a higher number of nodes, segments, and smaller mean mesh sizes were the most chaotic. It is inferred that these variables result from vascular sprouting and variation in vascular density and permeability and tip cells formed by sprouting filopodia toward proangiogenic signal sources and the interplay of pericytes and the endothelial wall, respectively. Furthermore, a model predicting the drug potency of aromatase target compounds with an r2 value of 0.512 was designed, and the in vitro experiments of P. polycephalum confirmed and compelled further investigation of how the tumour microenvironment impacts the morphology of angiogenesis. In conclusion, the remarkable network analysis of chaos theory and its affinity to angiogenesis compel further investigation, countless applications in predicting tumorous vasculature, drug discovery, and uncovering the chaotic rules that drive the biological networks in and around us. Below are the various applications and next steps for this project.
* Clinical diagnosis using studies of chaos theory by mathematicians that have identified the mathematical rules to determine the extent of unpredictability in a given system
* Bridging Biochemical and Mathematical Research for Novel Drug Discovery
* Investigation of the percolation of tumour angiogenesis via methods used to analyze scale-free networks
* Novel chaotic systems and network analysis methods such as the ones developed in this project are not exclusive to breast cancer vasculature—biological networks in and around us, from our nervous system to the spreading of contagious diseases, may demonstrate undiscovered chaotic properties
